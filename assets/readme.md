This folder is where you can store any Acklen or Hero Unit graphical assets so that they can be used throughout the web.

### Adding New Folders

When you want to add a new folder, you can do so directly in github.com. Just use the "Add a File" option above, type the name of the folder you want with a trailing slash (ex: `apple/`), then enter `readme.md` to create your initial readme file (like this one). 

### Readme Files

It's a good idea to have a readme file in every folder to provide extra context. Your readme file can include instructions on how to use the assets, where to find the originals, links to example PDF's or additional information. Remember that all this content is publicly accessible on the web, though. If something should be secret, don't add it. If you're adding a link to a document that should be secret, make sure the document's permissions are set appropriately.
